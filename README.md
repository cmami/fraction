# fraction
A fraction manipulation class

The class maintains accurate fractional values. 

Note that the integral num(erator) and den(ominator) member values may get altered by any of the methods as a side effect, e.g. num=2, den=6 may get changed to num=1, den=3. The fraction's value still stays correct, i.e. in this example "one third".
